# Roots Recordings Standard Operating Procedure: Client Onboarding

## Objective
To ensure a seamless onboarding experience for new clients.

## Procedure
1. [Send onboarding materials](#send-onboarding-materials)
2. [Send contracts](#send-contracts)
3. [Gather client materials](#gather-client-materials)

### Send onboarding materials

(This seems like something to be done only once: Create a welcome packet in Google Docs that includes a description of the services, pricing, deadlines, and frequently asked questions.)

Share the New Client Welcome Packet with new clients via email.

### Send contracts

Send contracts to new clients for signature via email. Use DocuSign for e-signatures.

Create a new folder on Google Drive for the client. Once client signatures are acquired, save the signed contracts in this folder.

### Gather client materials

Reach out to clients via email to request:
- logos
- intros
- any other assets needed for their podcast branding (such as regularly-used font typefaces)
