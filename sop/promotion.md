# Roots Recordings Standard Operating Procedure: Social Media and Podcast Promotion

## Objective
To promote podcast episodes across social media platforms with engaging visuals and copy.

## Procedure
1. [Design graphics](#design-graphics)
2. [Create social media posts](#create-social-media-posts)
3. [Schedule posts](#schedule-posts)
4. [Engagement tracking](#engagement-tracking)

### Design graphics
_Software to use_: Photoshop/Canva

Create visually appealing graphics for each episode (episode covers, quote images, etc.).

Use pre-made templates for consistency in branding (client logos, colors, fonts).

Save graphics in appropriate formats (JPEG/PNG for web).

### Create social media posts
Draft captions for posts promoting each podcast episode.

In each caption, include:
- hashtags
- episode links
- relevant calls to action (e.g., “Listen now” or “Subscribe”)

### Schedule posts
_Software to use_: Buffer/Hootsuite

Schedule posts to go live across multiple platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) on specific dates.

For each podcast, create and maintain a posting calendar that aligns with episode's release date.

(Do we need client social media account info for this?)

### Engagement tracking
Monitor engagement on social media posts (likes, shares, comments).
1. Log this information in a document on Google Docs (one document per podcast, with a new section for each week).
2. Share this document with Steve via Google Docs.
3. Make a section in the document for each new social media post.
4. Update the relevant engagement numbers for each social media post at the end of each day.
5. Every Friday, provide Steve with a weekly summary of this performance by sending him an email reminder containing a link to the up-to-date Google Doc.
